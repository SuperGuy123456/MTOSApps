## 📖 About the Project

**MTOS** is essentially a bootloader for the ESP32 that can download `.bin` files from the web (like those hosted in this repo) and store them on a microSD card. Using a touchscreen interface, it displays the available files, allowing the user to select one to flash.

Each `.bin` file follows a generic structure that includes a function to reflash the core OS — a protected `.bin` file that cannot be removed. This project is actively developed and tested on the **ESP32-2432S028R** (commonly known as the "Cheap Yellow Display"), but it should work on any ESP32 with proper configuration. To view specific features of the specific versions, please go to the `Readme.md` file in each folder and see the summary as well as what to expect.

## 🚀 Trying It Out

Unless you own an **ESP32-2432S028R** with the exact same pin configuration required by this project, you'll need to download the `.ino` file and modify the pin assignments and possibly the libraries.

For those using the **ESP32-2432S028R**, you can simply download the `.ino` file, flash it to your ESP32, and place the OS `.bin` file onto the microSD card.

## 📌 Features

- Downloads `.bin` files from a remote HTTP/HTTPS server  
- Saves the downloaded file to an SD card  
- Displays available files via touchscreen interface  
- Reads and flashes the selected binary from the SD card  
- Automatically reboots into the new firmware  
- Optional version tracking via `JSON`  

## 🧰 Requirements

- **ESP32-2432S028R** ("Cheap Yellow Display")  
- MicroSD card formatted as `FAT32` (recommended size < 16GB)  
- Wi-Fi access  
- `.bin` files hosted online  

## 🔄 Update Flow

1. ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi  
2. It downloads the `.bin` file from a specified URL  
3. The file is saved to the SD card  
4. The ESP32 reads the file from SD and flashes it using the `Update` class  
5. If flashing succeeds, the device reboots into the new firmware  

## Prepping the SD card

You **need** a folder called ```vpaths``` in the root directory of the sd card. This will ensure that MTOS can download the vpath files into the folder. Without it, after downloading the ```binpath.txt``` file, it will display a error while downloading the vpath files.
